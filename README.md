## ðŸ§  End-to-End ANN Classification using TensorFlow & Keras

This repository contains a complete end-to-end implementation of a binaryv classification problem using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. The project is designed to provide a clear and modular structure, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend for similar classification tasks.

### ðŸš€ Project Highlights
âœ… Preprocessing of tabular/classification dataset (standard scaling, encoding)

âœ… ANN model built using TensorFlow and Keras functional/Sequential API

âœ… Model training, evaluation, and performance visualization

âœ… Hyperparameter tuning (optional)

âœ… Well-documented and beginner-friendly
